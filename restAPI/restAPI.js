/* REST API -> representational state transfer (API-> application programming interface)
    REST API --> the way to define an API
    how should we make an API

    * ex: jokes API, weather API these all known as REST API -> these follow rest convention
    median of communication between channel name


    * what we make a rout using get is also an API in technically but it accesable with ou only (who build tht)
    bt its cant we call as REST API

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. uniform interface  -> its interface should be accesable with all web app, phone, any browser
        * resources based -> api.jokes.com/10/
        * manupulation -? it starts from /update -> data that we want to update basically manupulation
        
    2.  client server architechcture -> almost webs are build on cleint server architecture. ex: web 2.0
        -> web 3.0 based on block chain client -> blockchain
    3.  layered system -> 

        cleint                server A
        ------                 ------      B    C      D
        |     | ------------   |   |     |--|  |--|  |--|
        ------                 ------

            there are multiple server in background there is no restriction from which server
            we need to get data, whichevr the server gives the data.
            basicly API is not restricted to only one server.
            we should get proper data, from whichevr the server it doesnt matter

    4. cachable ->  there is a small memory in cach to store
        * like hashmap -> what is hashmap :
                        * its quick because of key and pair

        100 + 200 = 300 
        this result will be stored in cach if we again asked in sevre it gives the quick result because its already availble in 
        browser, no need to go server and process again
